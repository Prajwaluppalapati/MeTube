# MeTube
Hello coders, hack clubbers and everyone!
Welcome to MeTube™

MeTube is a funny version of YouTube. It is a "masterpiece" created by Prajwal Uppalapati
Profile -> https://prajwaluppalapati.github.io/PrajDev

I made this website with only 1% usage of AI :D
-> I used AI to make the navbar's background blur.
-> I used AI to create that glow animation for the heading. 
-> I used AI to make the loading circle at the end.

There is no media query for this website, as a result, the layout may vary on different screen sizes and may not look good on all devices.
A computer or a laptop is recommended to view this website. 
Sorry for the inconvenience :(

It only has UI but no function

Features:
-> It has a UI (almost the same as YouTube)
-> All features are made funny.
-> It has some videos, but they don't play or even open.
-> It also has shorts, but they don't play or even open.

Thankyou for visiting Metube™ >_<
